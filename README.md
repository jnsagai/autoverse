# 🚗 Autoverse

**Autoverse** is an open, modular vehicle simulation framework designed to enable development, integration, and validation of **virtual ECUs (vECUs)** within a realistic simulation environment. It bridges **CARLA** (vehicle simulator), **Zenoh** (data distribution), **QEMU** (virtualization), and **Linux** to create a powerful platform for software-defined vehicle (SDV) development.

---

## 🌐 Key Features

- 🔁 **Full-loop simulation** with CARLA for real-time vehicle and environment interaction.
- 🧠 **vECU support** via QEMU-based Linux images or Docker containers.
- 🧩 **Zenoh middleware** for flexible and scalable communication between vECUs, sensors, and vehicle models.
- 🛠️ Future Support for both **AUTOSAR Classic** (via lightweight emulation) and **Adaptive Platform** (POSIX-based).
- 📦 Docker-based and QEMU-based deployments.
